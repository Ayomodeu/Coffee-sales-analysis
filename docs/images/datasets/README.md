## Introduction â€“ Coffee Shop Sales Analysis

##### This project focuses on analyzing sales data from a coffee shop outlet, specifically centered around the sales of brewed herbal tea products at the Astoria branch over a period in June 2023. The dataset contains detailed transaction-level data, capturing each sale made at the store.

## Key Variables
##### 1.Transaction Date and Time: Timestamp for each sale, helping to track customer traffic patterns by time and day.
##### 2.Store ID and Store Location: Identifies the specific store location (Astoria) where the sales occurred.
##### 3.Product Details: Information about the product sold, including product ID, category (Tea), and type (Brewed herbal tea), with specific details like flavor (Peppermint).
##### 4.Sales Metrics: Columns for quantity sold, unit price, and total bill amount for each transaction.

## Purpose of the Analysis:
##### The main goal of this project is to conduct a comprehensive sales analysis that covers:
##### 1.Sales Trends Over Time: Identify daily and hourly sales patterns to understand peak sales periods.
##### 2.Product Performance: Evaluate how well the specific tea products (e.g., Peppermint Brewed Herbal Tea) are selling over time.
##### 3.Revenue Analysis: Analyze total revenue generated per day, per transaction, and track average sales per day.
##### 4.Customer Purchase Behavior: Understand customer purchase frequency patterns by looking at transaction counts over time.


## Project Workflow 
##### 1.Data Cleaning: Handling missing data, correcting any time or date inconsistencies, and checking for duplicate transactions.
